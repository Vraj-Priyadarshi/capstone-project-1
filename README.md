🎉 Excited to Share My First Capstone Project: Blackjack/21 Game! 🎉

I’m thrilled to announce the completion of my first capstone project where I developed a Blackjack/21 game. This project was a fantastic opportunity to apply my programming skills and deepen my understanding of game development and probability.

🔍 About the Project:

The deck is unlimited in size, meaning cards are not removed as they are drawn.
No jokers are included.
The Jack, Queen, and King each count as 10 points.
The Ace can count as either 11 or 1, depending on which is more advantageous for the player's hand.
Cards in the list have an equal probability of being drawn.
📚 Basic Knowledge About Blackjack:
Blackjack, also known as 21, is one of the most popular casino games worldwide. The objective is simple: get a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. Players are dealt two cards initially and can choose to "hit" (draw additional cards) or "stand" (keep their current hand). If a player's hand exceeds 21, they "bust" and lose the game. The dealer also plays by a set of rules, typically standing on 17 or higher and hitting on 16 or lower.

♠ Key Features of My Blackjack Game:

Implemented the core rules of Blackjack.
Ensured equal probability for drawing each card.
Dynamic Ace handling (counting as 11 or 1).
This project has been a wonderful learning experience, helping me to better understand game logic, probability, and decision-making algorithms. I'm looking forward to building on this experience and tackling more complex projects in the future.

If you're interested in discussing the project or have any feedback, I’d love to connect!
